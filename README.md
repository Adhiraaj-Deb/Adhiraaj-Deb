## Hi there 👋

I'm Adhiraaj, a Grade 11 student exploring AI, designing, computer engineering, and software development.

I co-founded Synalpy, where we’re building apps to help people focus, manage time, and break out of the doomscrolling cycle, helping you regain control of your time.

Right now, I'm working on Note(ly), an AI-integrated note-taking and productivity app aimed at helping people get back on track.

My current toolset includes Python, HTML, and limited JavaScript, and I'm learning CSS and CAD.
I code using Visual Studio Code and recently started using Google Antigravity.
